		 * ceil(x) x is rounded up to its nearest integer.

                   This integer is returned as a double value.
           rint(x) x is rounded up to its nearest integer. 
                    If x is equally close to two integers, 
                    the even one is returned as a double value.
          round(x) Returns (int)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a float 
                   and returns (long)Math.
                   floor(x + 0.5) if x is a double.
