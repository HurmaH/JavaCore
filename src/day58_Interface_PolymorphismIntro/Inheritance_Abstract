2 way to achieve abstraction in java
                                     1. abstract class
                                     2. interface

why interface: 1. multiple inheritance
               2.
INTERFACE:
         ALL PUBLIC: by default,access modifier for all members of Interface
         PUBLIC STATIC any fields 
members:
          constant : 
                         public static final field
          abstract method: 
                         //till JAVA8 , 
                         an in interface could only have above memebers default method
                         it is declared using default keyword and it has body
                         it makes easier to add new functionality into interface without breaking existing functionalities
          static method:
                        it's mostly used as utility method that not attached any object
          Object:       
                        we can only access static method of interface using static way--->> InterfaceName.methodName
                        It is not inherited
                        
        any fields are autimatically public static final 
	any method without a body --automatically public abstract 

	How many interface a class can implemnet -->> NO LIMIT 
		public class Student implement Teachable, Hirable, Offerable {}

	CAN a interface extends anotehr interface -->> YES , ONE OR MORE 
		public interface Mammal extends Animal, Pet, OtherInterfaces{

		} 
		the purpose is to reuse the methods that exists in interface 	that being extended 
                        
           
 ABSTRACT CLASS:
                it is declared using abstract keyword
                public abstract clas Student {
                }
                it cannot be instantinated : NO OBJECT
                it may contain abstract method
members: 
                Fields: 
                       instance+static
                       final + non-final
                       private, protected, default, public
                
                Constructor:
                       any constructor it can have like normal class
                
                methods:
                       abstract method
                       non - abstract method
                       instance + static
                       final method
                
                blocks:
                       instance
                       static block 
                       
How many class a class can extend -->>> ONLY 1 !!!!!

can a abstract class implements a interface 
		
		public interface Pet{
			public abstract void feedPet(); 
		}
		would this code compile ? 
		
		public abstract class Cat implements Pet{

			//public abstract void feedPet(); 

		}	
		public class SpartanCat extends Cat{
			public void feedPet(){
				//feed your cat with milk 
			} 
		}
