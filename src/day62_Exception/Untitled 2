 EXCEPTION:
          is object and have class, that comes from related  and package
          1. Compile error
          2. IndexOutOfBoundException
          3. NullPointerException
          4. ArithmaticException
          5. ClassCastException
          NullPointerException npe = new NullPointerException(); 
          throw npe;
Exception Handling:
                   Any type of action to process any kind of error
                   (catch, recover, notify, diagnose)
TRY CATCH block 
               is used to wrap up a piece of code that anticipated to throw certain type of Exception                 
               and catch the exceptiontht happen if it happen
               and either try to recover from it or just report it 
               so the program does not shutdown and continue to execute
       
try {
// some code that might throw exception
} catch (Exception e) {
// TODO: handle exception
}

try {
// some code that might throw exception
} catch (Exception e) {
// TODO: handle exception
}finally {
// actions regardless of exception thrown or not
}

important one type excepption canno be cought by another type of Exception

but there is MULTI TRY CATCH:
        //whenever there is exception comes, program goes outside of try block immidiatly
		//looks for related catch
                             try {
									// some code that might throw exception
							 } catch (ArithmaticException e) {
									// TODO: handle exception
							 } catch (NullpointerException e) {
									// TODO: handle exception
							 } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e){
									//atch (Aritmetic e)
							 }
another constructor of exception class with argument 

throwable is a interface

CHECKED EXCEPTION:  There are some exceptioptions that need to be handled before running program
UNCHECKED EXCEPTION:MUST be handled at runtime
