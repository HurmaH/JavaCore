ArrayList VS LinkedList

ArrayList: 
          is backed by array, whenever we try to add or remove item
          it's automatically resizing underlying array for us
          so we can just call the method
LinkedList:


Adding & Removing items:
        in situation adding and removinf it is better to use LinkedList 
        1.LinkedList is faster: because it is just need to creat new pointer to the neighbour
        2.ArrayList is slower: because of resizing operation in underlying

Random Access by index/ get(4)
        in situation accessing randomlyovinf it is better to use LinkedList 
        1.LinkedList is slower: it has to go through each and every neighbour before the element
        2.ArrayList is fatser: it can directly jump to the element since it's backed by array
