Polymorphism:
             is ability of the object taking many form
             or an object can be referred by it's own type or it's super class type
             or it's interface type that the class implemented
             
POWER POLYMORPHISM:
                  making correct decision at runtime according actual object type
                  to call the overriden version of the method
                  
                  EX: Animal a1 = new Dog();
                  a1.makeNoise(); //woof woof
                  
                  This will give us a lot of flexibility while writing to code
                  we can easily swap the implementation to get correct behaviorat runtime
                  we can group objects together by it's general types and take general actions without worrying about details
                  
                  EX: Animal[] allAnimals = {new Dog(), new Cat(), new Horse()};
                      for (Animal each : allAnimal) {
                           each.makeNoise();
                      }
                  
                      
                  EX: What you can access using a2 reference?
                      Animal a2 = new Horse();
                      
                      Answer: only the members that available in Animal class
                              in order to access Horse specific members

What’s accessible is purely decided by reference type 
for any kind of members, we have the method in super class , 
we are overriding in sub class so we have them both in 
super class and sub class for overridden method

COmpile time it picks from reference type, during run time 
                           
                           if the method is overriden it will use that one
                           if the field is hidden Reference type decides to use parent field, 
                               since fields cannot be overriden but hidden
                           if static method is hidden Referance type will choose parent static option

we get all methods automatically and inside body of those method , it call super class version of the method 
by default if it is not overridden as we saw on screen
  
  
  STATIC POLYMORPHISM: METHOD OVERLOADING
  DYNAMIC OVERLOADING: METHOD OVERIDING, mostly used one
