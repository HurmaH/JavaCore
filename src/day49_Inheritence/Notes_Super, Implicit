Difference between this(...);  and super(args...);
this()  ---> is used to call constructor of same class in another constructor
super() ---> is used to call super class's constructor in child class

super (arg...) rules:
                     1. it has to be the first statement
                     2. it can be only be used on time per constructor
                     3. super() and this() cannot be mixed together
                     4. even if super() is not called compiler will call implicitly 
                     5. super(100); // if this was not given compiler would run implicitly no arg compiler, but this time it runs super class constructor with one arg 
                     
   Implicit behavior of compiler

automatic type widening / up casting 
long i = 10  

Wrapper type auto boxing and un boxing 
Inteter i = 10 ; 
i = new Integer(10) ; 

Constructor 
  if you don't have any constructor 
  compiler will add no arg constructor 

  public YourClassName(){

  }

  first line of any constructor is always a call to 
  super classes no arg constructor if it's not already called 
  using either super(args...). or this(arg...)

  public YourClassName(){
    super() ; 
  }
