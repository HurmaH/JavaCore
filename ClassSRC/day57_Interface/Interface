INTERFACE: 
         -Only constant field
         -Abstract Methods
         -Default methods
         -Static methods
         -constructor: not allowed

//Default method -- allowed only in interface
                    It is defined using default keyword and it has body
	                We can just inherit it as is 
	                or we can override to provide actual implementation
	                you can call abstract method in default method
	                concrete class will have implementation anyway

//static method  -- of interface is not inherited
