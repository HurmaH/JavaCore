Abstraction:
           means we focus on the essential qualities of something rather than
           abstract keyword is used to create abstract method

Abstract method: does not have body, only have signature
                 As long as there is one abstract method 
                    whole class should be abstract
                 
                 can be overloaded:
                 EX: 
                    public abstract void eat(String food);
                    public abstract void eat (String food, int amount);
                    
Abstraction class: concrete method
                   can have everything that normal class can have
           
           this 
           Ex:
              public abstract void attendClass();
           if there is at least one abstract method, class should be abstract:
           Ex:
              public abstract class Student{}
           can not create abstract class obj,
           it provides guide line to subclass
           
 every abstract method need to be implemented
                           1. Add implemented method
 
 FINAL, PRIVATE, STATIC Methods cannot be abstract, as they cannot be Overriden
 
 Static method   : cannot be overriden so it cannot be abstract method
 Final  method   : cannot be overriden so it cannot be abstract method
 Private methods : cannot be overriden so it cannot be abstract method
 
 ABSTRACT SUB CLASS:
                   NOT REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT/OVERRIDE ABSTRACT METHODS, INHERITED FROM SUPER CLASS
                   has option to provide implementation so subclass of this class can use 
                   it as is or override what is inherited
